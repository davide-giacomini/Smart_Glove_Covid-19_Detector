\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a solution for overcoming the problems that were issued by the Covid-19.

The doctor is actually able to test if the patient could be ill without even the need to touch them with their hand (Figure \ref{fig:doctor}).

We are proud to have shared with you our work.
